Build a complete **AML (Anti-Money Laundering) developer dashboard** app in React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui. The dashboard is for fintechs, payment platforms, and financial institutions to monitor suspicious transactions and manage developer access. 

**Key Requirements:**
- **Inline Sections Only:** API management, Settings, Billing, and Profile sections must appear **inline within the dashboard**, not as separate pages. Users can expand/collapse or tab between these sections.
- **Real-time Transaction Monitoring:** Display a live transaction feed with risk scores.
- **Risk Heatmap:** Visual map showing high-risk regions, accounts, or transaction types.
- **Alerts Panel:** List flagged transactions with severity and reason.
- **Case Management:** Track investigations with status and notes.
- **Sanctions & PEP Monitoring:** Highlight matches with blacklists.
- **Analytics & Trends:** Charts showing suspicious transaction trends over time.
- **Compliance Reports:** Exportable PDF/CSV reports for regulators.
- **User & Account Profiles:** Detailed risk profiles.
- **Filtering & Search:** Interactive filters by date, country, transaction type, and risk score.
- **API Management Inline Section:** Create, rotate, delete, view, and copy API keys; show usage metrics.
- **Settings Inline Section:** Manage account preferences, notifications, and security (2FA, password reset, IP restrictions).
- **Billing Inline Section:** Show subscription plan, invoices, payment methods, and upgrade/downgrade options.
- **Profile Inline Section:** Edit personal info, manage developer profile, API limits, and activity logs.
- **Search & Quick Access:** Search transactions, accounts, API keys, or reports; quick links to frequently used sections.

**Libraries / Modules to Use (Free):**
- Charts: Recharts, Chart.js + react-chartjs-2, Victory, React-Vis
- Tables: React Table, Material-UI DataGrid (free version)
- Maps: React Leaflet, Google Maps React
- Notifications & Alerts: React Toastify, shadcn/ui Alerts & Badges
- UI Components: shadcn/ui, Radix UI
- Filtering & Search: React Select, Downshift
- Drag & Drop / Layout: React Grid Layout, Framer Motion
- Real-time Data / State Management: React Query, SWR, Redux Toolkit
- Backend / API: Supabase or Firebase (for free real-time data, authentication, and billing simulation)

**Tech Stack:** React + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for frontend; Recharts/Chart.js for charts; React Table for tables; React Leaflet for maps; React Query + Supabase for real-time data; Framer Motion for animations; React Toastify for alerts.

**Goal for AI:** Generate a **fully interactive, responsive dashboard skeleton** with all sections inline. Include charts, tables, maps, alerts, filters, API management, Settings, Billing, and Profile as inline collapsible/tab sections. Provide placeholders for all features listed above so backend integration can be added later.
